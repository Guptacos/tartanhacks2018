# tartanhacks2018
Repository for our 2018 TartanHacks project

This project was created by:
Niko Gupta nikolasg@andrew.cmu.edu
Logan Kojiro lkojiro@andrew.cmu.edu
Joel Miller jgmiller@andrew.cmu.edu
Haiwen Liu haiwenl@andrew.cmu.edu

The goal of this project is primarily eduational. We hope that our project can
be used to help teach students (of any age and level of expertise) more about
digital circuits.

(insert how - to instructions for installation and use)
(talk here about how everything works. I left it blank because I don't think
any of us know how it all works lol.)
